  /**

   * 
   * The directions are given as a 2D array, where each inner array is a [row, column]
   * pair that describes a move. For example, if given the below array it would be possible
   * to move to the right, up, down, or down/left diagonally.
   * {
   *  {0, 1},  // Right
   *  {-1, 0}, // Up
   *  {1, 0},  // Down
   *  {1, -1}  // Down/left diagonal
   * }
   * 
   * However, the player can not move off the edge of the board, or onto any 
   * location that has an 'X' (capital X).
   * 
   * The possible moves are returned as a List of [row, column] pairs. The List
   * can be in any order.
   * 
   * Example:
   * 
   * board: 
   * {
   *  {' ', ' ', 'X'},
   *  {'X', ' ', ' '},
   *  {' ', ' ', ' '}
   * }

   * directions:
   * {
   *  {0, 1},  // Right
   *  {-1, 0}, // Up
   *  {1, 0},  // Down
   *  {1, -1}  // Down/left diagonal
   * }
   * 
   * expected output (order of list is unimportant):
   * [{2, 2}, {2, 1}]
   * 
   * Explanation:
   * The player starts at {1, 2}.
   * The four directions the player might have to go are right, up, down, and down/left (based on the directions array).
   * They cannot go right because that would go off the edge of the board.
   * They cannot go up because there is an X.
   * They can go down.
   * They can go down/left.
   * The resultant list has the two possible positions.
   * 
   * 
   * You can assume the board is rectangular.
   * You can assume valid input (no nulls, properly sized arrays, current is in-bounds,
   * directions only move 1 square, any row/column pairs are arrays of length 2,
   * directions are unique).
   * 
   * If there are no possible moves, the method returns an empty list.
   * 
   * @param board a rectangular array where 'X' represent an impassible location
   * @param current the [row, column] starting position of the player
   * @param directions an array of [row, column] possible directions
   * @return an unsorted list of next moves
